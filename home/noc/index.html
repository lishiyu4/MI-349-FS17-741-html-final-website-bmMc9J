      <h1 class="my-4 top">Astral</h1>
      <p>"Old tales tell of six gods who have stood watch over Eos since antiquity. It is said they now slumber, conserving their strength, waiting to awaken upon the coming of a plague known as the Starscourge. â€”"The Six and the Oracle"</p>

          <h2 class="my-4">Story</h2>
        </div>
        <p>During the Old Calender Era, the Astrals were active across Eos. When a meteorite fell to Eos, Titan is said to have caught it, and in modern times it is known as the Meteor of the Six*. Humans were created in the Astrals' image, and though most Astrals were indifferent to man's fragile and ephemeral existence, the God of Fire, Ifrit, admired their strength of will. Granting mankind his flame, a civilization flourished: Solheim. Ifrit's benevolence warmed Shiva's heart, who likewise came to love humans and fell in love with Ifrit.

        Some people of Solheim began to see themselves as superior to the gods and spurned their blessings. Due to the perceived betrayal of the Astrals by Solheim's people, Ifrit declared war on them, triggering the Great War of Old. The Six are sworn to protect Eos, even from each other, and thus the other Astrals turned against Ifrit. The conflict was magnified by the appearance of the Starscourge, a plague that killed millions and Solheim collapsed. The Great War of Old led to the creation of two major landmarks; Taelpar Crag was created during the battle between Ifrit and Bahamut, while the Rock of Ravatogh was where Ifrit's original body was laid to rest following his death.</p>

          <h3>Titan<br>
            <small>-Goddness of Earth-</small>
          </h3>
          <p>The Archean Titan is the God of Earth who resides in Disc of Cauthess under the glowing meteorite. He is a giant who uses Gaia's Wrath to damage enemies and has a higher chance of appearing after Noctis's allies have been defeated. When summoned, Titan appears in the distance, picks up a large piece of earth, and tosses it at the enemies in Noctis's vicinity. When this lands, several gigantic pillars of earth rise from the ground to damage nearby foes. </p>

          <h3>Ramuh<br>
            <small>Goddness of Thunder</small>
          </h3>
          <p>The Fulgurian Ramuh is the God of the Storm, overseeing the natural laws of Eos. He is a bearded old wizard dressed in flowing robes. He uses Judgment Bolt when outside a dungeon to deal heavy damage to all opponents within a wide radius. Inside a dungeon, Ramuh simply throws his staff at his foes from afar. When Ramuh is called upon, he scoops Noctis up with his left hand and wraps his staff in lightning. He then tosses the staff at the enemies below him, triggering a massive explosion that chars the surrounding landscape. Ramuh can be called upon in almost every area, and he has a higher chance of appearing the longer a battle lasts. </p>

          <h3>Leviathan<br>
            <small>Goddness of Seas</small>
          </h3>
          <p>The Hydraean Leviathan, Goddess of the Seas, dwells in Altissia. She is a colossal sea serpent, and is described as elegant, intelligent, and "very close to the gods."[6] Though she has slumbered there since the end of the Great War of Old, Altissia's residents are wary of Leviathan, for she is known as cruel and not to hesitate to drown her surroundings.Leviathan is capable of disguising herself and traveling in liquid form; she cannot be summoned unless there is a body of water nearby, and she only appears to Noctis if he is in Danger. </p>

          <h3>Shiva<br>
            <small>Goddess of Ice</small>
          </h3>
          <p>The Glacian Shiva is the Goddess of Ice, and is openly fond of humanity. When summoned, she freezes the surrounding landscape. She appears alongside several copies of herself and uses her signature attack, Diamond Dust. Shiva's summon chance increases for each party member in KO/Danger, and the time the player has spent in battle. Shiva needs some space to be summoned, but can be summoned nearly anywhere.</p>

            <small>Goddness of War</small>
          </h3>
          <p>The Draconian Bahamut is the God of War, and the only Astral to remain active in the wake of the Great War of Old. He appears as a giant man in dark armor with wings made out of swords. Unlike other Astrals, Bahamut is only called during Noctis's battle with the penultimate boss. When summoned, he uses Ultima Sword, an attack that causes several massive blades to rain down on the enemy.</p>

            <small>Godness of Fire</small>
          </h3>
          <p>The Infernian Ifrit, God of Fire, is a hostile Astral who plays an important role in Eos's history. In the Old Calendar Era, he betrayed the rest of his kind and caused the downfall of Solheim and began the Great War of Old. Ifrit cannot be summoned by Noctis.</p>
